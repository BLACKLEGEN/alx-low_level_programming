# Command-Line Argument Handling in C

This project explores the use of `argc` and `argv` in C programming for effective command-line argument handling. The included files demonstrate different aspects of working with command-line arguments.

## Files Included

### 1. 0-whatsmyname.c

**Description:**
A program that prints its name, followed by a new line. If you rename the program, it will print the new name without having to compile it again. The program does not remove the path before the name of the program.

### 2. 2-args.c

**Description:**
A program that prints the number of arguments passed into it. Your program should print a number, followed by a new line.

### 3. 3-mul.c

**Description:**
A program that multiplies two numbers. Your program should print the result of the multiplication, followed by a new line. It can assume that the two numbers and the result of the multiplication can be stored in an integer. If the program does not receive two arguments, it should print "Error," followed by a new line, and return 1.

### 4. 4-add.c

**Description:**
A program that adds positive numbers. It prints the result, followed by a new line. If no number is passed to the program, it prints "0," followed by a new line. If one of the numbers contains symbols that are not digits, it prints "Error," followed by a new line, and returns 1. It can assume that numbers and the addition of all the numbers can be stored in an integer.

## Usage

Each program has its specific usage that is described in its respective section above.
