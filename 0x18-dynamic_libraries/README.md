## Project Overview

This project focuses on the creation and usage of dynamic libraries in the C programming language on a Linux system. It covers the basics of dynamic libraries, including their differences from static libraries, the creation of dynamic libraries, and their utilization. The project aims to provide a deeper understanding of how dynamic libraries work and how to leverage them in C programming.

## Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this project, the learner should be able to:

- Explain the concept of dynamic libraries and their functionality.
- Understand how to create dynamic libraries on a Linux system.
- Familiarize themselves with the environment variable `$LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and its usage.
- Differentiate between static and shared libraries.
- Gain basic proficiency in using tools such as `nm`, `ldd`, and `ldconfig`.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following tasks:

### Task 0: A library is not a luxury but one of the necessities of life

Create a dynamic library named `libdynamic.so` containing various C functions.

### Task 1: Without libraries what have we? We have no past and no future

Create a script (`1-create_dynamic_lib.sh`) that generates a dynamic library (`liball.so`) from all the `.c` files in the current directory.

## Project Files

- `libdynamic.so`: Dynamic library created in Task 0.
- `liball.so`: Dynamic library generated by the script in Task 1.
- `main.h`: Header file containing function prototypes.
- `1-create_dynamic_lib.sh`: Bash script for creating the dynamic library from all `.c` files.
- Other `.c` files: Implementation of functions required in Task 0.

## Compilation and Usage

To compile the dynamic library in Task 0:

```bash
$ gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -shared -fPIC -o libdynamic.so *.c
```

To run the example in Task 0:

```bash
$ gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -L. 0-main.c -ldynamic -o len
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=.:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
$ ./len
```

To run the script in Task 1:

```bash
$ ./1-create_dynamic_lib.sh
```

## Notes

- All code is written in accordance with the Betty style.
- The project is developed and tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using GCC.
- Ensure all files are executable, and follow the specified guidelines in the project requirements.
