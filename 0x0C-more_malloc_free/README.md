# 0x0C More Malloc and Free

This project focuses on memory allocation in C and covers various memory management functions like `malloc`, `free`, `realloc`, and more. The project includes several source code files, each implementing different aspects of memory allocation and manipulation.

## Files Included

- `0-malloc_checked.c`: Implements a `malloc_checked` function to allocate memory and check for allocation failure.

- `1-string_nconcat.c`: Contains a `string_nconcat` function to concatenate a portion of two strings, allocating memory as needed.

- `2-calloc.c`: Implements a `*_calloc` function that allocates and initializes memory for an array.

- `3-array_range.c`: Contains a function `array_range` that creates an array of integers with a specified range.

- `100-realloc.c`: Implements a `*_realloc` function to change the size of a dynamically allocated memory block.

- `101-mul.c`: A program that multiplies two positive numbers.

- `main.h`: A header file that includes function prototypes and necessary declarations for the project.

- `_putchar.c`: A function to print a character, used in the project for character output.

- `README.md` (this file): Provides an overview of the project and its contents.

## Usage

Each source file is designed to be used independently, but they can also be integrated into your own C programs as needed. The header file (`main.h`) contains function prototypes for the functions defined in these files.

For more detailed usage and examples, refer to the individual source code files and any associated documentation they may contain.

## About

This project is part of the curriculum at (https://www.alxafrica.com/), and it focuses on memory management in the C programming language. It covers various aspects of dynamic memory allocation and manipulation to enhance your understanding of memory-related operations.

Feel free to explore and utilize the provided code and functions in your C projects, and don't hesitate to refer to the individual source files for detailed implementation details.
