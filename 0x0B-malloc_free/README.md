Creating a README file for your C project is an essential part of documenting and sharing your code with others. Below is a template for a README file for a project related to memory allocation in C:

## Description

This project is part of the "C - Malloc and Free" series, which explores dynamic memory allocation in the C programming language. In this project, we have implemented several functions to allocate and deallocate memory using `malloc` and `free`. These functions can be used for various memory management tasks, such as creating arrays, duplicating strings, concatenating strings, and working with 2D arrays.

## Project Files

1. `0-create_array.c`: Function that creates an array of characters.
2. `1-strdup.c`: Function that duplicates a string.
3. `2-str_concat.c`: Function that concatenates two strings.
4. `3-alloc_grid.c`: Function that allocates memory for a 2D array.
5. `4-free_grid.c`: Function that frees the memory allocated for a 2D array.
6. `100-argstostr.c`: Function that concatenates command line arguments into a single string.
7. `101-strtow.c`: Function that splits a string into words.

## Compilation

To compile these functions, you can use a C compiler, such as GCC. Here's an example of how to compile the functions:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic <source_file.c> -o <output_program>
```

Replace `<source_file.c>` with the source file of the function you want to compile (e.g., `0-create_array.c`) and `<output_program>` with the desired name for the output executable.

## Usage

Each function can be used independently in your C programs. Make sure to include the appropriate header file and link the compiled object file to your program.

Example of using the `create_array` function:

```c
#include "holberton.h"

int main(void) {
    char *my_array;

    my_array = create_array(10, 'H');
    if (my_array != NULL) {
        printf("%s\n", my_array);
        free(my_array);
    }
    return (0);
}
```
