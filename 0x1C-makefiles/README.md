## Project Name: Curriculum - C - Makefiles

### Introduction
This project focuses on learning and understanding Makefiles in the context of programming in C. The project consists of several tasks that progressively build upon each other to help you grasp the concepts related to Makefiles and their practical implementation.

### Project Details
- Software Engineering
- **By:** Rugwiro parfait
### Resources
To successfully complete this project, you are required to read or watch the following resources:
- [What is a makefile and how does it work](#)
- [Installing the make utility](#)
- [make-official documentation](#)
- [More about Makefile](#)

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following without assistance:
- What are make and Makefiles?
- When, why, and how to use Makefiles?
- What are rules and how to set and use them?
- What are explicit and implicit rules?
- What are the most common/useful rules?
- What are variables and how to set and use them?


### Tasks Overview
1. **Task 0:** Create your first Makefile.
2. **Task 1:** Create a Makefile with variables for compiler and source files.
3. **Task 2:** Develop a useful Makefile with variables for compiler, source files, object files, and executable name.
4. **Task 3:** Create a Makefile with rules for cleaning, compiling, and managing object files.
5. **Task 4:** Develop a complete Makefile with additional compiler flags and enhanced rules.
6. **Task 5:** Implement a Python function to calculate the perimeter of an island without using any modules.
